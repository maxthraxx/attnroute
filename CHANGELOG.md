# Changelog

All notable changes to attnroute will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.5] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- `update_attention()` referenced removed global `_search_index` instead of
  `get_search_index()`, causing NameError for users with bm25s installed.
  This was the same lazy-init bug partially fixed in 0.5.4 — second
  occurrence at line 624 was missed. The crash caused the UserPromptSubmit
  hook to silently fail, preventing all context injection.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- `attnroute ingest` — bootstrap learner from Claude Code conversation history
  in ~/.claude/projects/. Parses JSONL transcripts to seed co-activation patterns,
  prompt-file affinity, and file rhythms so you don't start cold on established projects
- Git worktree support — worktrees sharing the same repo now share project
  identity, attention state, and keywords.json (resolves via git rev-parse --git-common-dir)
- Version sync test to prevent __init__.py / pyproject.toml drift
- SWE-Pruner (arxiv 2601.16746) added to related work acknowledgments

### Changed
- README benchmark framing: realistic per-query token comparison (50-200K → 2-5K)
  with methodology-labeled 99.87% figure in benchmarks section
- Extended compat.py usage to session_init, learner, compressor

### Fixed
- `scan_projects()` now checks CWD first and searches two levels deep from home,
  fixing "No projects found" for projects in ~/code/*, ~/dev/*, etc.
- Warning message referenced nonexistent `attnroute-setup` command, now correctly
  says `attnroute init`
- Stale `global _search_index` reference in ensure_search_index_built() now
  uses get_search_index() accessor

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- `attnroute/compat.py` - Centralized import utilities (`try_import`, `LazyLoader`)
- Prediction accuracy metrics in README (Precision ~45%, Recall ~60%, F1 0.35-0.42)

### Changed
- Lazy initialization for `Learner` and `SearchIndex` (no side effects at import time)
- Replaced dual import boilerplate with `try_import()` utility in context_router.py
- Updated predictor.py docstring with honest benchmark metrics

### Fixed
- Module-level instantiation side effects that could affect testing

### Added
- CHANGELOG.md for version history tracking

### Fixed
- Version sync between `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- Toned down README stats to more conservative "90%+" claims
